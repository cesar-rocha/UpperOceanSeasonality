title:  Seasonality in governing dynamics at submesoscales

abstract: Two new high-resolution numerical simulations with embedded tides suggest a
        strong modulation in the governing near-surface dynamics at submesoscales
            (roughly 10-100 km). Consistent with recent studies, deep late Winter mixed layers
                are prone to baroclinic instabilities and submesoscale turbulence
                    prevails in late Winter/early Spring. Inertia-gravity waves, on the other hand, are enhanced near
                        the surface when the upper ocean in strongly stratified. Thus the summertime
                            re-stratification weakens submesoscale turbulence and enhances intertia-gravity
                                 waves near the surface. In the Kuroshio Extension region,
                                     inertia-gravity waves strongly dominate the surface kinetic energy and
                                         sea-surface height variance in late Summer/early Fall at scales as large as 80 km!
