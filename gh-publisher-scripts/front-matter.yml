title:  Seasonality in governing dynamics at submesoscales

abstract: Two new high-resolution numerical simulations with embedded tides suggest a
        strong modulation in the governing near-surface dynamics at submesoscales
            (roughly 10-100 km) in the Kuroshio Extension. Consistent with recent studies, deep late-Winter mixed layers
                are prone to baroclinic instabilities, and submesoscale turbulence
                    prevails in late Winter/early Spring. While summertime
                        re-stratification weakens submesoscale turbulence, it also enhances inertia-gravity
                             waves near the surface. In the Kuroshio Extension,
                                 inertia-gravity waves strongly dominate the submesoscale surface kinetic energy and
                                     sea-surface height variance in late Summer/early Fall.
